A simple & fast open-source WebDav desktop client


----------

### About

After setting up an [owncloud](https://owncloud.org/) server, I realised there aren't any WebDav applications with  modern UI and features. That's where Mounter Drive comes in, by allowing you to access your remote server with basic file management features and a simplistic UI.

### Current Features

 1. Download & Upload File Management
 2. File Directory Tree and Basic Control
 3. Simple & Beautiful UI
 4. Search System
 5. Open-Source

### Development
A big part of the apllication is based on [this](https://github.com/perry-mitchell/webdav-client) nodejs webdav libary.

#### Install Dependencies
    npm install
    
#### Running
    npm start
    npm run electron
    
#### Packaging for release
    yarn run dist

### Todo (Sorted by priority)

 1. Multi-Select
 2. Add other cloud services
 3. Add themes
 4. Streaming videos
 5. Image viewer
